# Using-open-sourced-Crowd-mapping-to-improve-citizen-and-government-engagement
 Hello citizens of the world:-), welcome to this project. My name is Winnie from Kenya, a country located in the eastern side of Africa:-)I am excited to have you all here to learn, contribute and offering insights to help us come up with a workable solution for the project.
 My four friends and I (mostly with a public health background and one with background in international relations and law) had an idea to help citizens in my country have an easier way of reporting issues of public health that affect them to the authorities.
 
### What is this project about?
I would like to put together a team of collaborators to create a mobile phone based solution that is open and easily accesible to citizens to enable them communicate to their respective authorities regarding issues of health and education. 
These authorities could be any structure/institution/government that is repsonsible for public health and/or education. The communciation tool aimed at here is mobile phone.

#### Aim
1. To have a mobile phone based solution that is open-source in nature ,that is easily modified by any user(s) and publicly available. The solution will be accesible and easy to use as a channel of communciation for citizens to authorities in charge of public health and education
2. To improve citizen engagement with their governemnts and other relevant authorities on issues of public health and education

#### Why?
Health and education are important public services that enhance country's development and to a large extent the world. They say "a healthy educated nation is a wealthy nation".


#### Who will use it? 
Anyone- Citizens of the world/countries/communities
